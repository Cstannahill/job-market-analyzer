  "description": "DeepSeek-V3.1 is a large hybrid reasoning model (671B parameters, 37B active) that supports both thinking and non-thinking modes via prompt templates. It extends the DeepSeek-V3 base with a two-phase long-context training process, reaching up to 128K tokens, and uses FP8 microscaling for efficient inference. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean. [Learn more in our docs](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#enable-reasoning-with-default-config)\n\nThe model improves tool use, code generation, and reasoning efficiency, achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 on difficult benchmarks while responding more quickly. It supports structured tool calling, code agents, and search agents, making it suitable for research, coding, and agentic workflows. \n\nIt succeeds the [DeepSeek V3-0324](/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) model and performs well on a variety of tasks.",
